*** Important Upgrade Notice ***

Since version 0.96, everything in the "silaspartners" directory has been 
moved into the "tantan-flickr" directory.

Additionally, the plugin object $SilasFlickrPlugin has also been renamed to 
$TanTanFlickrPlugin.

If you've made modifications directly to files inside this directory, be sure 
to back them up and copy them to the tantan-flickr directory. Otherwise, you
should be able to safely delete this directory since it's no longer used. You
may need to update your theme to reference the new tantan-flickr directory, 
particularly if you have been initializing the $SilasFlickrPlugin object 
directly inside your PHP code.

Note: You may need to re-activate this plugin from your "Plugins" admin screen.
