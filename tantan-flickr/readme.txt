This Flickr plugin for WordPress will allow you to pull in your Flickr photosets and display them as albums on your WordPress site.

== Description ==

This Flickr plugin for WordPress will allow you to pull in your Flickr photosets and display them as albums on your WordPress site. There is a pretty simple template provided which you can customize to 100% match the look and feel of your own site. 

The plugin includes a number of customization options to allow you to hook it up with Lightbox or any other number of popup overlay display libraries. Third party commenting services such as Disqus are also supported, allowing your visitors to comment on your photos without hopping over to Flickr.com.

A simple Flickr widget is also included to let you easily include your photos into your blog's sidebar.

On the backend, this plugin will add a new Flickr icon to your WordPress edit screen which will allow you to easily insert your Flickr photos and albums into your blog posts with just a couple clicks. You can either have your inserted photos link back to your WordPress Flickr photo album or directly to your Flickr.com photo page.

1. Upload `tantan-flickr` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
