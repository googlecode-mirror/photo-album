#summary Enable groups support in this plugin

= Show Groups =

Add the following to the TOP of your wp-config.php, along with the other define statements:

{{{
define('TANTAN_FLICKR_DISPLAYGROUPS', true);
}}}

Once done, you'll be able to use the plugin to pull in and display Flickr groups you have joined. Your wp-config.php should look something like this. 

{{{
<?php
define('TANTAN_FLICKR_DISPLAYGROUPS', true);

// ** MySQL settings ** //
define('DB_NAME', '...');
... etc ...
}}}

*Important* Make sure you only load photos from groups for which you have permission to re-display photos.
