#labels Featured

== Installation ==

 # Unpack / unzip the archive
 # Copy the entire "tantan-flickr" directory to your Wordpress plugins directory. Your wordpress plugins directory should be something like [WORDPRESS DIR]/wp-content/plugins. Upgrading Note: Just overwrite all the files inside the tantan-flickr directory. If you made edits, then make sure you make a backup just in case something goes wrong!
 # Go into your Wordpress admin, click on the "Plugins" tab, and then activate "Flickr Photo Gallery".
 # Click on the "Options" (or "Settings") tab, and click the "Photo Album" subtab to bring up the options screen.
 # Just follow the onscreen prompts to link your photo album to your Flickr account.
 # Once your photo album is linked to your Flickr account, enter a URL where you want your photo album to appear.
 # You're done! To view your photo album, just go to the URL you entered in the previous step. To insert a photo, just click on the Flickr icon  in your "Add media" bar when editing posts. Click on a photo, select a size, and a HTML snippet for that photo will appear in the post's textarea. *Cool!* If you're using WordPress 2.3 or older, then you should a new "Photos" tab next to your uploading tabs.

== Photo Album Customization ==

 # All the templates are located inside a "templates" folder inside the tantan-flickr directory.
 # If you just want to customize a particular template, just copy that template into your current theme directory
 # To completely customize the look and feel, copy all these template files (they all start with photoalbum-) into your current theme directory and modify as necessary.
 # Modify the HTML and CSS in the template files to fit your own site. All the CSS is referenced from the template file photoalbum-header.html
 # That's it!

== Popup Overlay Support ==

The plugin comes bundled with 4 different display libraries, hosted on TanTanNoodles: Lightbox, Facebox, FancyZoom, and Fancybox. [http://tantannoodles.com/flickr-demo/ Here's a quick demo of these display libraries]. These libraries are hosted for your convenience, you are *encouraged* to download these libraries and install them on your own server.

If you already have a display library installed on your site and would like to use that instead of a bundled library, then you will need to modify [http://code.google.com/p/photo-album/source/browse/trunk/tantan-flickr/templates/photoalbum-resources.php this resource file] (found in the templates directory). You'll need to tweak that PHP file a bit. 

To use one of the hosted bundled display libraries, add the following to the TOP of your wp-config.php file:

For _[http://leandrovieira.com/projects/jquery/lightbox/ Light Box]_, add this code:

{{{
define('TANTAN_DISPLAY_LIBRARY', 'lightbox');
}}}

For _[http://fancy.klade.lv/ Fancy Box]_, add this code:

{{{
define('TANTAN_DISPLAY_LIBRARY', 'fancybox');
}}}

For _[http://famspam.com/facebox Face Box]_, add this code:

{{{
define('TANTAN_DISPLAY_LIBRARY', 'facebox');
}}}

For _[http://www.cabel.name/2008/02/fancyzoom-10.html Fancy Zoom]_, add this code:

{{{
define('TANTAN_DISPLAY_LIBRARY', 'fancyzoom');
}}}


In the end, your wp-config.php should look something like this:

{{{
<?php
define('TANTAN_DISPLAY_LIBRARY', 'facebox');

// ** MySQL settings ** //
define('DB_NAME', '...');
... etc ...
}}}

*Notes:*
 # Depending on your blogs theme, there may need to be a little bit of JavaScript / CSS mojo.
 # Here's a page with [http://planetozh.com/projects/lightbox-clones/ a list of all the various libraries] you might want to use if you want to use your own.
 # Take a peek inside the file photoalbum-resources.php to see how to hook up the plugin with a custom display library.
